Hi I'm SteveJaH, the owner of FaceAttendance code that you forked.
I couldn't find email or other stuff to contact you, so I made this file.

I'd found that there was some images and videos of me and my friend...... and I didn't realize that images are publicly shown.

I deleted these files in my github and make a little description in the directory, but..

In your otilrac/FaceAttendance github, my images are remained and they can publicly access.

Please 'Fetch origin' and replace your FaceAttendance repository to my new ('master's) repository.
And thank you for forking my repository. :)
